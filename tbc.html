<p2>The official website for the original television anime Tada-kun wa Koi o Shinai (Tada-kun Does Not Fall in Love) revealed the main cast, new visual, and story information on Friday.


The website describes the anime as a "slapstick romantic comedy that will make you laugh and cry." In the story, Mitsuyoshi Tada, a boy who has never known love, is taking pictures of the cherry blossoms in full bloom when he meets Teresa Wagner, a transfer student from Luxembourg. Upon arriving in Japan, she got lost, separated from her travel companion. Mitsuyoshi helps her and brings her to his grandfather's coffee shop.

The cast and characters are as follows:

Yūichi Nakamura (Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun's Nozaki) as Mitsuyoshi Tada, a second-year high school student in the photography club. He works part time at his grandfather's coffee shop and aims to be a cameraman like his late father. He does not speak often but cares for his friends. (Image Color: Blue)

Manaka Iwami (Urahara's Kotoko) as Teresa Wagner, a second-year high school girl from Luxembourg with blonde hair and green eyes. She has a bright and docile personality, and a shining smile. She loves a certain Japanese historical drama. (Image Color: Green)

Mamoru Miyano (Free! - Iwatobi Swim Club's Rin) as Kaoru Ijūin, Tada's childhood friend, who is also in the photography club. When he's silent he appears to be attractive and cool, but he is usually noisy. He is the heir to a generations-old restaurant in Ginza, so his cooking skills are excellent. (Image Color: Yellow)

Shino Shimoji (Aikatsu!'s Akari) as Alexandra Magritte, another transfer student who came with Teresa from Luxembourg. She has red hair and an impressive sense of style. She and Teresa are childhood friends, and she would do anything to protect Teresa. (Image Color: Red)

Yuichiro Umehara (Snow White with the Red Hair's Mitsuhide) as Hajime Suzamoto, Tada and Ijūin's upperclassman and the head of the photography club. He is smart, gets good grades, and is good at photography, but he always says exactly what's on his mind. His dream is to be a photographer of nudes. (Image Color: Purple)

Shizuka Ishigami (Food Wars! Shokugeki no Soma's Nikumi) as Hinako Hasegawa, Suzamoto's childhood friend and a member of the photography club. She joined half under duress, because the club would be shut down for having insufficient membership. She is an honor student who can handle any task flawlessly. She keeps her long hair in a braid. (Image Color: Orange)

Hiro Shimono (Attack on Titan's Conny) as as Gentarō Yamashita, the only first-year student in the photography club. He has a somewhat feminine look and keeps his bangs up with a clip. He went to the same middle school as Tada, and looks up to him. (Image Color: Light Blue)

Inori Minase (Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?'s Hestia) as Yui Tada, a second-year middle school student and Mitsuyoshi Tada's younger sister. She is a cheerful girl who keeps her black hair in a bob cut. She likes mystery novels. (Image Color: Pink)

Renaissance) is directing at Doga Kobo (Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun, Touken Ranbu: Hanamaru).

<a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/konohana-kitan/episode-6/.123495"><p>Konohana Kitan Episode 6 by James Beckett, Nov 2nd 2017</a></p>
<p2>Coming off last week's surprisingly affecting fairytale, the first few minutes of this episode seem to show Konohana Kitan taking a hard-left turn into a completely different genre: the horror story. Admittedly, the overly-grainy filter gives away the gag, but the sight of the incredibly creepy Japanese doll stalking the home of a terrified family is a little eerie. Putting our fox girls into a straight-up scary story could have made for the perfect Just-Barely-Missed-Halloween episode.

That being said, it works just as well when the whole setup is just an excuse to put that cranky haunted doll into the hands of the Konohanatei girls, who are literally too ridiculous to be scared. Despite ostensibly being brought in by a travelling priest who is trying to exorcise the doll's demonic spirit, our girls manage to get the job done in the most anime way of all, through the power of friendship. The poor creature is given the absurdly cutesy name of Okiku, subsequently dressed up and made over by Konohanatei's adorably enthusiastic crew. While the overly loud and frenetic humor didn't always land for me, the overall tone of the segment won me over eventually. Seeing Sakura gleefully brandish her scissors in a way that even managed to scare Okiku was a particular highlight. If anything, this episode helped cement just how comfortable Konohana Kitan has become with its fluid tone and warm cast of characters, effortlessly sliding from slice-of-life to heartfelt drama, and then back to madcap comedy without skipping a beat. For a show that's only been around for a handful of episodes, Konohana Kitan feels remarkably comfortable in its own skin, which makes for excellent feel-good entertainment.

The biggest surprise of the episode may have been that Okiku's story wasn't just a one-off adventure, but an introduction to Konohanatei's newest (and smallest) maid. The reformed Okiku is adorable for sure, and her small size provides ample opportunities for new brands of slapstick, especially when she teams up with Urinosuke. The only misstep with the second half of this episode would be the rather clumsy way it transitions from Okiku's orientation to Yuzu's story. The second act of the episode begins as a continuation of the first, and the script emphasizes Okiku's brash and naïve approach to her new job. The logical conclusion would be for Okiku's attitude to begin to slowly shift as she interacts with the hotel's guests more, but instead she literally passes the baton (or rather, the rice balls) to Yuzu, and the third act of the story transforms into something entirely unrelated to Okiku's character. There's nothing wrong with veering away from expected narrative patterns, but since Okiku disappears from the episode entirely after the halfway mark, it leaves that initial act two setup feeling awkwardly crammed between two separate stories.

This isn't too much of an issue, since that third segment works strongly as a standalone vignette, taking the show's visual direction down an unexpectedly effective path. For much of the episode's second act, I was distracted by the uncharacteristically muted color palette, as if the show's normally bright and fluid animation was being filtered through a muddy grey veil. It wasn't until Yuzu began walking past the lush blue flowers, carrying her own deeply red umbrella, that I caught on to the artistic impulses behind the palette swap. The spring rains have overstayed their welcome, and the oppressive grayness of the season is literally bleeding into Konohana Kitan's visuals. This would only be a mildly clever change-up in direction on its own, but the payoff that comes with Yuzu's story takes it to another level.

As a standalone bit, Yuzu's interactions with the obsessive weaver would be perfectly adequate storytelling, but when combined with the hypnotic animation of the weaving and the methodical camera work, the whole segment becomes something of a tone poem. Yuzu's earnest friendliness helps the weaver overcome her self-neglect and take more personal joy from her work, and the final reveal that she was weaving a rainbow all along is a perfectly gentle resolution that packs a visual punch, with the color of Konohana Kitan's world springing back to life at full force. Konohana Kitan demonstrates a subtle mastery over episodic slice-of-life storytelling with the way it expertly combines the mythic with the mundane in each story.

Somehow, in a season that's positively jam-packed with prestige titles and exciting action sagas, Konohana Kitan is working its way to the top of the autumn's rankings for me. It's so modest in its ambition that it's easy to overlook, but the series has managed to be remarkably successful with every new week that passes by. I don't imagine this will become some sort of breakout hit, but with any luck more people will realize just how sweet and fun this show is turning out to be.

Rating: B+

Konohana Kitan is currently streaming on Crunchyroll.

<p2>The official website for the Bungo Stray Dogs anime franchise began streaming a trailer for the Bungo Stray Dogs: Dead Apple anime film on Wednesday. The video reveals that the film will open in Japan on March 3.



The website also revealed a key visual, cast list, and story summary. Most of the cast members are returning from the television anime, with Kazuya Nakai joining the cast as Tatsuhiko Shibusawa (pictured below).



The returning cast members include:

Yūto Uemura as Atsushi Nakajima
Mamoru Miyano as Osamu Dazai
Kensho Ono as Ryūnosuke Akutagawa
Kishō Taniyama as Chūya Nakahara
Sumire Morohoshi as Kyōka Izumi
Yoshimasa Hosoya as Doppo Kunikida
Hiroshi Kamiya as Ranpo Edogawa
Toshiyuki Toyonaga as Junichirō Tanizaki
Hiroyuki Kagura as Kenji Miyazawa
Yu Shimamura as Akiko Yosano
Chiaki Omigawa as Naomi Tanizaki
Rikiya Koyama as Yukichi Fukuzawa
Mitsuru Miyamoto as Ougai Mori
Sora Amamiya as Elise
Junichi Suwabe as Sakunosuke Oda
Jun Fukuyama as Ango Sakaguchi
Akira Ishida as Fyodor D.
The film's story involves a mystery case of power users around the world suddenly committing suicide one after another, in all cases after a strange fog appears at the scene. At a request from Ango Sakaguchi, the Armed Detective Agency head out to investigate Tatsuhiko Shibusawa, a power user who calls himself "collector," and a man suspected of being tied to the incident.

Bungo Stray Dogs: Dead Apple will open in Japan in early spring 2018.

Takuya Igarashi is returning to direct the film at BONES. Yoji Enokido is returning to write the film, in collaboration with original manga writer Kafka Asagiri. Nobuhiro Arai is returning as character designer and chief animation director, Fumihiro Katagai is the mechanical designer, and Taku Iwasaki is returning to compose the music. Kadokawa Animation is distributing the film.

GRANRODEO, the band that performed the first television anime's opening theme song, is returning to perform the opening theme song for the film. Luck Life, the group that performed the ending theme songs for both anime seasons, is returning to perform the film's ending theme song.

The first television anime adaptation of Kafka Asagiri and Sango Harukawa's Bungo Stray Dogs manga aired in April-June 2016, and Crunchyroll streamed the series as it aired in Japan. The anime's second 12-episode series aired from October-December, and Crunchyroll again streamed the series as it aired. Funimation and Crunchyroll plan to release the series on home video with an English dub.

The manga is also inspiring a stage play adaptation and a smartphone game. An OVA shipped with the manga's 13th compiled volume on August 4.

The "battle action" story centers around a league of literary figures with supernatural powers. For example, in real life, Ryūnosuke Akutagawa wrote acclaimed stories that inspired Akira Kurosawa's Rashōmon film and the Aoi Bungaku Series anime's Jigoku Hen (Hell Screen) arc. In Bungo Stray Dogs, he has the power to transform and manipulate his cloak into a monster-like entity. Together, some of these writers solve mysteries as part of the "Armed Detective Agency," while others appear as antagonists.

Yen Press published the fourth volume of the manga in English on September 19.

<p2>Andrew Partridge of Anime Limited has posted comments to the forum of Anime UK News (here and here), relating to the upcoming home release of Makoto Shinkai's your name. The forum had recently reported some critical claims about the technical quality of the Blu-ray edition of the film.

In his posts, Patridge said there would be no formal replacement scheme 'as the disc does pass muster from a industry standpoint and the majority of viewers (in this case the mass market) experience won't be impacted.' However, Partridge also said:

What I will do for fans is if they watch the Blu-Ray and are not satisfied is they can email us at shop.uk@alltheanime.com with a subject line of YOUR NAME - BLU-RAY and write us a (polite and short) email saying what your issue with the Blu-Ray is then we'll replace it with a disc using a fresh master when we get it in as we're going to make sure the video is improved for the second print run. You'll need to post us the disc back at your own cost and we'll replace it then at our own cost inc return shipping.</p2>
